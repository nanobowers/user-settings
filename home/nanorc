# Emacs-like keybindings for nano
# Note: nano does not support multi-key sequences (e.g., Ctrl+X Ctrl+C), so only single-key bindings are possible.
# Some Emacs features are not available in nano.

# Cursor movement
bind ^A home main              # Move to beginning of line (Emacs: Ctrl+A)
bind ^E end main               # Move to end of line (Emacs: Ctrl+E)
bind ^N down main              # Next line (Emacs: Ctrl+N)
bind ^P up main                # Previous line (Emacs: Ctrl+P)
bind ^F right main             # Forward character (Emacs: Ctrl+F)
bind ^B left main              # Backward character (Emacs: Ctrl+B)
bind M-< firstline main        # Move to first line (Emacs: Alt+<)
bind M-> lastline main         # Move to last line (Emacs: Alt+>)

# Word movement
bind M-F nextword main         # Forward word (Emacs: Alt+F, Ctrl+Right Arrow)
bind M-B prevword main         # Backward word (Emacs: Alt+B, Ctrl+Left Arrow)

# Editing
bind ^D delete main            # Delete character (Emacs: Ctrl+D)
set cutfromcursor              # Kill to end of line (Emacs: Ctrl+K)
# If this does not work as expected, your nano may not support 'cutfromcursor'.
# In that case, you can only use 'cut' (cuts the whole line) or mark a region and cut.
bind ^Y paste main             # Yank (paste) (Emacs: Ctrl+Y)
bind ^T execute all            # Transpose characters (Emacs: Ctrl+T)
bind ^J enter main             # Insert new line (Emacs: Ctrl+J)

# Redraw/Refresh
bind ^L refresh main           # Redraw screen (Emacs: Ctrl+L)

# Search
bind ^S whereis main           # Search forward (Emacs: Ctrl+S)
bind ^R wherewas main          # Search backward (Emacs: Ctrl+R)

# Undo/Redo
bind ^_ undo main              # Undo (Emacs: Ctrl+_, usually Ctrl+Shift+-)
# Note: nano does not support redo by default.

# File operations
bind ^X exit main              # Exit (Emacs: Ctrl+X Ctrl+C, but only single key possible)
bind ^O writeout main          # Save (Emacs: Ctrl+X Ctrl+S, but only single key possible)
bind ^G help main              # Help (Emacs: Ctrl+H)

# Marking and cutting
bind ^@ mark main              # Set mark (Emacs: Ctrl+Space)
bind ^W cut main               # Cut region (Emacs: Ctrl+W)
bind M-W copy main             # Copy region (Emacs: Alt+W)

# Limitations:
# - No support for multi-key sequences (e.g., Ctrl+X Ctrl+C).
# - No rectangle editing, macros, or advanced mark commands.
# - Some Emacs keys may conflict with terminal or OS shortcuts.
# - Redo is not available by default in nano.
